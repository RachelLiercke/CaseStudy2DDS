# CaseStudy2DDS
### DDSAnalytics was able to find that Research Scientists and Sales Exectuives had the most overtime. Research Directors had the most education while Sales Representative had the least amount of education. Laboratory Technicians had the most trainings. There was no trends on Marital Status, but Sales Reps and Research Scientists had the most attrition.

### Monthly Income was predicted by using linear regression and using these predictors: Department, Job Level, Total Working Years, and Years with Current Manager. Our RMSE value was roughly 1300, which is under the 3000 threshold.

### Using an intense analysis of linear regression, knn, and Naive Bayes models, we were able to predict Attrition well over the 60% specificity and sensitivity levels. Our analysis used a Naive Bayes model using these factors: Age, Department, Distance, Environment, Jon Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Marital Status, Number of Companies worked for, Over Time, Work Life Balance, Years in current role, Years Since last Promotion, and Years with Current Manager.


### We have provided the company with our predictions from the datasets without their respective missing values. If you have any questions, please reach out to me or our company. Thanks!
